# Requirements–Verification Traceability Matrix (Module 1)

> **Purpose**: Track mapping from requirements → tests → coverage items → checks  \
> **Module**: 1 – Verification Planning & Management Foundations (SV/UVM)

> **Instructions**: Fill in this document for your design. Copy from `module1/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module1/` directly. Reference: `module1/.solutions/`. For section-by-section guidance see [docs/FILL_GUIDES.md](../../docs/FILL_GUIDES.md#module-1---requirements-matrix).

## 1. Instructions

> **How to fill**: Add 1–2 sentences on how you will maintain requirement IDs (e.g. R1, R2, …) and keep mappings consistent across this file and the verification plan.

<!-- TODO: Add notes on how you'll maintain IDs and mappings. -->

## 2. Requirement List

> **How to fill**: Add a markdown table with columns: Req ID, Description, Priority (H/M/L), Notes. One row per requirement (e.g. | R1 | … | H | … |).

<!-- TODO: Table of Req ID, description, priority, notes. -->

## 3. Requirement → Test Mapping

> **How to fill**: For each requirement, list which test IDs exercise it. Use a table or bullet list (e.g. R1 → T1, T2).

<!-- TODO: Map each requirement to one or more tests (Test IDs). -->

## 4. Requirement → Coverage Mapping

> **How to fill**: For each requirement, list which coverage items (covergroups/coverpoints/code) measure it. Use a table or bullet list.

<!-- TODO: Map each requirement to functional/code coverage items. -->

## 5. Requirement → Checkers / Assertions

> **How to fill**: For each requirement, list which scoreboards, assertions, or protocol checkers verify it.

<!-- TODO: Map each requirement to scoreboards, assertions, protocol checkers. -->

## 6. Test Definitions (Summary)

> **How to fill**: Define each test ID with name, intent, type (smoke/feature/stress/error), and priority. A short table is enough.

<!-- TODO: Define test IDs (name, intent, type, priority). -->

## 7. Coverage Item Definitions (Summary)

> **How to fill**: List coverage IDs and what they measure (covergroups/coverpoints/crosses/code). Keep definitions short.

<!-- TODO: Define coverage IDs (covergroups/coverpoints/crosses/code). -->

## 8. Traceability Checklist

> **How to fill**: Add a short checklist to confirm every requirement has at least one test, one coverage item, and one checker/assertion. Tick off as you complete.

<!-- TODO: Checklist to confirm every Req has tests/coverage/checks. -->
