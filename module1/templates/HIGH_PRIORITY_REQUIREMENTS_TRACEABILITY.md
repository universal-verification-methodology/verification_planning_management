# High-Priority Requirements Traceability Summary

> **Purpose**: Quick reference showing where each high-priority requirement is tested, covered, and checked  \
> **Module**: 1 – Verification Planning & Management Foundations

> **Instructions**: Fill in this document for your design. Copy from `module1/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module1/` directly. Reference: `module1/.solutions/`. For guidance see [docs/FILL_GUIDES.md](../../docs/FILL_GUIDES.md#module-1---high-priority-requirements-traceability).

## Overview

> **How to fill**: In 2–3 sentences, summarize how high-priority requirements (Priority=H) are mapped to tests, coverage, and checkers. Reference the main REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md for full detail.

<!-- TODO: Summarize how high-priority requirements map to tests, coverage, and checkers. -->

## High-Priority Requirements

> **How to fill**: For each Priority=H requirement (e.g. R1, R2, …), list: risk/complexity, test IDs that exercise it, coverage IDs that measure it, and checker/assertion IDs that verify it. Use a table or one short block per requirement.

<!-- TODO: For each Priority=H requirement (e.g., R1, R2, ...), include:
- Risk and complexity
- Where it's tested (test IDs)
- Where it's covered (coverage IDs)
- Where it's checked (checker/assertion IDs)
-->

## Traceability Matrix Summary

> **How to fill**: One short paragraph on overall traceability health: e.g. “All H-priority requirements have tests and coverage; gaps: …”.

<!-- TODO: Short summary of overall traceability health and any gaps. -->

## Verification Strategy Summary (3-5 Minute Explanation)

> **How to fill**: A short “elevator pitch”: what you verify, how (strategy and key tests), and why (risk and coverage goals). 3–5 sentences is enough.

<!-- TODO: A short "elevator pitch" explaining what you verify, how, and why. -->

## References

> **How to fill**: Links to DUT spec, module docs, and any internal references.

<!-- TODO: Links to specs and module docs. -->
