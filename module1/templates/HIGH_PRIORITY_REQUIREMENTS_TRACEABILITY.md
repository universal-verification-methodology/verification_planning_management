# High-Priority Requirements Traceability Summary

> **Purpose**: Quick reference showing where each high-priority requirement is tested, covered, and checked  \
> **Module**: 1 – Verification Planning & Management Foundations

> **Instructions**: Fill in this document for your design. Copy from `module1/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module1/` directly. Reference: `module1/.solutions/`.

## Overview

<!-- TODO: Summarize how high-priority requirements map to tests, coverage, and checkers. -->

## High-Priority Requirements

- Risk and complexity
- Where it's tested (test IDs)
- Where it's covered (coverage IDs)
- Where it's checked (checker/assertion IDs)
