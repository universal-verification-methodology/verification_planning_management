# Module 1: Verification Planning & Management Foundations

This directory contains **implementation artifacts** for Module 1.

**For full learning objectives, detailed syllabus, and instructions, see [`../docs/MODULE1.md`](../docs/MODULE1.md).**

## Quick Reference

- **DUT RTL**: Located in [`../common_dut/rtl/`](../common_dut/rtl/)
- **Testbench**: Located in [`../common_dut/tb/`](../common_dut/tb/)
- **Planning artifacts**: See files in this directory (e.g., `VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`, `REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`)

This module focuses on **verification planning and management** - the primary deliverable is a clear, reviewable plan that guides later coding and regression work.

## Self-paced learning

- **`templates/`** — Empty/skeleton versions of the planning docs. Copy from here if you need a fresh copy.
- **`.solutions/`** — Filled-in reference solution (hidden). View when you want to compare or understand the methodology.
- **Files in this directory** (e.g. `VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`, `REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`) — Your workspace. Edit these directly or copy from `templates/`, then run `../scripts/module1.sh` to validate.
