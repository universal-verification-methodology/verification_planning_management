# Module 8 Checklist – Capstone: End‑to‑End Verification & VIP Delivery

> **Purpose**: Track completion of your major capstone project.

## 1. Capstone Definition

- [x] Capstone project chosen and described in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md`.  
- [x] Key requirements and success criteria documented.  
- [x] Scope (block/subsystem/VIP) clearly defined and realistic for the time frame.  

## 2. Re‑use of Earlier Modules

- [x] Existing plans (verification, test, coverage, regression) referenced and extended, not reinvented.  
- [x] UVM env/checker designs from Modules 4–6 reused or evolved.  
- [x] Regression and orchestration concepts from Module 5 applied.  

## 3. Implementation Progress (High‑Level)

- [x] Environment / VIP skeleton implemented in code.  
- [x] Core tests running and passing on the chosen DUT/IP.  
- [x] At least one coverage‑enabled regression run executed.  

## 4. Evidence of Full Lifecycle

- [x] Planning: Updated plan(s) exist for this capstone (even if in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md`).  
- [x] Environment: UVM env/VIP implements the architecture you described.  
- [x] Tests & Regressions: Tests are mapped to tiers/jobs and can be run via scripts/CI.  
- [x] Coverage: Coverage model is implemented and measurement is demonstrated.  
- [x] Checks: Scoreboards/checkers/assertions are in place and used to determine pass/fail.  

## 5. Deliverables and Documentation

- [x] Code is organized and discoverable (where to find DUT, env, VIP, tests, scripts).  
- [x] User/maintainer docs exist (README/how‑to run, high‑level design notes).  
- [x] Capstone deliverables listed in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md` are present.  

## 6. Retrospective

- [x] Retrospective section in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md` filled in after completion.  
- [x] Strengths and weaknesses of the solution identified.  
- [x] Concrete ideas for next steps or future improvements captured.  

## 7. Course Completion

- [x] You can present your capstone as if to a project/peer review:
  - [x] Problem and requirements.  
  - [x] Architecture and environment.  
  - [x] Tests, coverage, regressions, and key results.  
  - [x] Lessons learned and proposed improvements.
