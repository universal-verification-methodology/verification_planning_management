# Module 8 Checklist – Capstone: End‑to‑End Verification & VIP Delivery

> **Purpose**: Track completion of your major capstone project.

> **Instructions**: Check off items as you complete them. Copy from `module8/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module8/` directly. Reference: `module8/.solutions/`.

## 1. Capstone Definition

- [ ] Capstone project chosen and described in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md`.
- [ ] Key requirements and success criteria documented.
- [ ] Scope (block/subsystem/VIP) clearly defined and realistic for the time frame.

## 2. Re‑use of Earlier Modules

- [ ] Existing plans (verification, test, coverage, regression) referenced and extended, not reinvented.
- [ ] UVM env/checker designs from Modules 4–6 reused or evolved.
- [ ] Regression and orchestration concepts from Module 5 applied.

## 3. Implementation Progress (High‑Level)

- [ ] Environment / VIP skeleton implemented in code.
- [ ] Core tests running and passing on the chosen DUT/IP.
- [ ] At least one coverage‑enabled regression run executed.

## 4. Evidence of Full Lifecycle

- [ ] Planning: Updated plan(s) exist for this capstone (even if in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md`).
- [ ] Environment: UVM env/VIP implements the architecture you described.
- [ ] Tests & Regressions: Tests are mapped to tiers/jobs and can be run via scripts/CI.
- [ ] Coverage: Coverage model is implemented and measurement is demonstrated.
- [ ] Checks: Scoreboards/checkers/assertions are in place and used to determine pass/fail.

## 5. Deliverables and Documentation

- [ ] Code is organized and discoverable (where to find DUT, env, VIP, tests, scripts).
- [ ] User/maintainer docs exist (README/how‑to run, high‑level design notes).
- [ ] Capstone deliverables listed in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md` are present.

## 6. Retrospective

- [ ] Retrospective section in `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.md` filled in after completion.
- [ ] Strengths and weaknesses of the solution identified.
- [ ] Concrete ideas for next steps or future improvements captured.

## 7. Course Completion

- [ ] You can present your capstone as if to a project/peer review:
  - [ ] Problem and requirements.
  - [ ] Architecture and environment.
  - [ ] Tests, coverage, regressions, and key results.
  - [ ] Lessons learned and proposed improvements.
