This directory contains **implementation artifacts** for Module 2.

**For full learning objectives, detailed syllabus, and instructions, see [`../docs/MODULE2.md`](../docs/MODULE2.md).**

## Quick Reference

- **DUT RTL**: Located in [`../common_dut/rtl/`](../common_dut/rtl/)
- **Testbench**: Located in [`../common_dut/tb/`](../common_dut/tb/)
- **Planning artifacts**: See files in this directory (e.g., `TEST_PLAN.md`, `REGRESSION_PLAN.md`, `COVERAGE_PLAN.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`)
