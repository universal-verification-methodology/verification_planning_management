# Module 6: Complex Multi-Agent & Protocol Testbenches

This directory contains **implementation artifacts** for Module 6.

**For full learning objectives, detailed syllabus, and instructions, see [`../docs/MODULE6.md`](../docs/MODULE6.md).**

## Quick Reference

- **DUT RTL**: Located in [`../common_dut/rtl/`](../common_dut/rtl/)
- **Testbench**: Located in [`../common_dut/tb/`](../common_dut/tb/)
- **Planning artifacts**: See files in this directory (e.g., `MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROTOCOL_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`, `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`)

Module 6 focuses on **multi-agent, protocol-heavy testbenches** and layered testbench architecture.

## Self-paced learning

- **`templates/`** — Empty/skeleton versions of the planning docs. Copy from here if you need a fresh copy.
- **`.solutions/`** — Filled-in reference solution (hidden). View when you want to compare or understand the methodology.
- **Files in this directory** (e.g. `MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROTOCOL_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`, `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`) — Your workspace. Edit these directly or copy from `templates/`, then run `../scripts/module6.sh` to validate.
