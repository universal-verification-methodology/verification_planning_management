# Integration & System-Level Scenarios (Module 6)

> **Purpose**: Describe how your components, agents, and protocols integrate at block, subsystem, and (optionally) system level, and define key end-to-end verification scenarios.  
> **Module**: 6 – Complex Multi-Agent & Protocol Testbenches (SV/UVM)

> **Instructions**: Fill in this document for your design. Copy from `module6/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module6/` directly. Reference: `module6/.solutions/`.

## 1. Integration Levels

<!-- TODO: Table of Level (block/subsystem/system), Description, Scope/Components Included. Which levels are in-scope. -->

## 2. Integration Architecture

<!-- TODO: How agents and components connect at chosen integration level. Agents, cross-block, reuse. Textual diagram or description; connections. -->

## 3. System-Level Scenarios

<!-- TODO: Table of Scenario ID, Description, Level, Agents/Interfaces Involved, Notes. Preconditions, sequence, expected outcomes per scenario. -->

## 4. Cross-Block / Cross-Agent Checking

<!-- TODO: How end-to-end correctness is verified across components. Combined scoreboard, cross-checks, time-based if needed. Table of Check ID, Description, Inputs, Notes. -->

## 5. Configuration Across Levels

<!-- TODO: How configuration is managed across blocks/subsystems (config DB, plusargs, etc.). -->

## 6. Regression & Coverage at Integration Level

<!-- TODO: Which regression jobs and coverage apply at integration level; tier mapping. -->

## 7. Open Issues and Future Extensions

<!-- TODO: Open items and planned extensions. -->

## 8. Revision History

<!-- TODO: Document revisions. -->
