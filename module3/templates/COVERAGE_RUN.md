# Coverage Runs Log (Module 3)

> **Purpose**: Record coverage-enabled regression runs, key metrics, gaps, and follow-up actions.  
> **Module**: 3 – Coverage Planning & Analysis in Practice (SV/UVM)

> **Instructions**: Fill in this document for your design. Copy from `module3/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module3/` directly. Reference: `module3/.solutions/`.

## 1. Instructions

- Use this file as a **lightweight lab notebook** for coverage work.
- For each significant run, add an entry with:
  - When, what tests, which DUT version, which simulator.
  - Key summary metrics (functional + code).
  - Notable gaps and hypotheses.
  - Planned closure actions.

## 2. Run Entries

### Run 1 – (add title)

<!-- TODO: Date, Engineer, DUT Revision, Environment (simulator, UVM/tool versions). Test Set/Tier, tests, seed policy. -->

#### 2.1 Functional Coverage Summary (High-Level)

<!-- TODO: Table of Coverage ID, Metric/Notes. -->

#### 2.2 Code Coverage Summary (High-Level)

<!-- TODO: Statement, branch, toggle/condition, excluded regions. -->

#### 2.3 Observed Gaps

<!-- TODO: Table of Area, Observation/Gap, Hypothesized Cause. -->

#### 2.4 Planned Actions

<!-- TODO: Table of Area/Gap, Planned Action, Owner, Target Module. -->

#### 2.5 Notes

<!-- TODO: Any additional notes. -->
