# Coverage Design (Module 3)

> **Purpose**: Define the concrete functional coverage model (covergroups/coverpoints/crosses) and how it is integrated into your UVM environment.  
> **Module**: 3 – Coverage Planning & Analysis in Practice (SV/UVM)

> **Instructions**: Fill in this document for your design. Copy from `module3/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module3/` directly. Reference: `module3/.solutions/`.

## 1. Context and Scope

<!-- TODO: DUT name, main interfaces, reference docs. Which features/requirements this coverage design targets. -->

## 2. Coverage Components and Placement

<!-- TODO: Table of Coverage ID, UVM Component/File, Sampling Event, Notes. Data source and shared trigger. -->

## 3. Covergroup Specifications

### 3.1 Operations Coverage

<!-- TODO: Covergroup goal, coverpoints, crosses, requirements covered. -->

### 3.2 Occupancy / Level Coverage

<!-- TODO: Covergroup goal, coverpoints, crosses, requirements covered. -->

### 3.3 Backpressure Coverage

<!-- TODO: Covergroup goal, coverpoints, crosses, requirements covered. -->

### 3.4 Error / Status Coverage

<!-- TODO: Covergroup goal, coverpoints, crosses, requirements covered. -->

## 4. Sampling Strategy and Performance Considerations

<!-- TODO: Sampling events, performance impact, shared triggers. -->

## 5. Integration Hooks in UVM Environment

<!-- TODO: Where covergroups are instantiated, how they connect to monitor/env. -->

## 6. Coverage–Requirements Mapping

<!-- TODO: Map coverage IDs to requirement IDs (R1, R2, …). -->

## 7. Early Closure Strategy

<!-- TODO: How you plan to close coverage gaps (tests, constraints, waivers). -->

## 8. Open Questions and Future Extensions

<!-- TODO: Open items and future coverage additions. -->

## 9. Revision History

<!-- TODO: Document revisions. -->
