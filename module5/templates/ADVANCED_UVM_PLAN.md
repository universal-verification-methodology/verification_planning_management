# Advanced UVM Orchestration Plan (Module 5)

> **Purpose**: Plan how advanced UVM features (virtual sequences, virtual sequencers, complex configuration, callbacks, register model usage) will be used to support your regression strategy.  
> **Module**: 5 – Regression Management & Advanced UVM Orchestration (SV/UVM)

> **Instructions**: Fill in this document for your design. Copy from `module5/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module5/` directly. Reference: `module5/.solutions/`.

## 1. Context

<!-- TODO: DUT/System composition, agents/interfaces, related docs. Which advanced UVM features you intend to use and why. -->

## 2. Virtual Sequencer and Virtual Sequences

### 2.1 Virtual Sequencer Design

<!-- TODO: Table of Virtual Sequencer, Sequencers Controlled, Purpose/Scope. Placement and binding. -->

### 2.2 Virtual Sequences and Scenario Mapping

<!-- TODO: Map virtual sequences to test IDs/scenarios. Phases and coordination. -->

## 3. Configuration Objects and Hierarchical Config

<!-- TODO: Table of Config Class, Scope, Key Fields, Notes. Set/propagation/validation. -->

## 4. Callbacks and Instrumentation

### 4.1 Callback Targets

<!-- TODO: Table of Callback Target, Callback Class, Purpose, When Active. -->

## 5. Register Model Usage (If Applicable)

<!-- TODO: If DUT has registers: adapter, predictor, integration. Otherwise: N/A. -->

## 6. Interaction with Regression and Coverage

<!-- TODO: Which jobs use which advanced features; impact on coverage and regression. -->

## 7. Open Questions and Future Enhancements

<!-- TODO: Open items and planned improvements. -->

## 8. Revision History

<!-- TODO: Document revisions. -->
