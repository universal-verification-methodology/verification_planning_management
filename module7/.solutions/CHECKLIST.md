# Module 7 Checklist – Real-World Applications & VIP

> **Purpose**: Track completion of Module 7 real-world projects and VIP design.

## 1. Project Definition

- [x] At least one substantial project is defined in `projects.md`.  
- [x] For each project:
  - [x] DUT/IP and scope documented.  
  - [x] Key requirements and use cases listed.  
  - [x] Verification approach outlined (env, tests, coverage, regressions).  

## 2. VIP / Environment Design

- [x] `vip_design.md` created and filled for at least one VIP or environment.  
- [x] VIP components identified (agent, driver, monitor, sequencer, scoreboard, checker, coverage).  
- [x] Interfaces and transactions documented.  
- [x] Protocol rules / checks and coverage aspects documented.  
- [x] Configuration and reuse strategy documented.  

## 3. Implementation Progress (High-Level)

- [x] Initial env/VIP skeleton implemented in code (not just template).  
- [x] At least some basic tests run end-to-end on the chosen DUT/IP.  
- [x] Initial coverage reports or sanity metrics collected (where applicable).  

## 4. Best Practices

- [x] `best_practices.md` reflects project-specific decisions and standards.  
- [x] Code structure is clean (no obvious tangle of unrelated responsibilities).  
- [x] Naming and documentation are consistent and clear.  
- [x] Tests and regressions can be run and understood by another engineer.  

## 5. Reflection and Review

- [x] Projects and VIP design reviewed with peer/mentor or self-reviewed critically.  
- [x] Lessons learned and potential improvements captured in `projects.md` and/or `best_practices.md`.  

## 6. Ready to Conclude the Course

- [x] You can:
  - [x] Walk through your VIP/env project as if presenting to a design/verification review.  
  - [x] Explain how planning, environment, coverage, regression, and architecture decisions support your goals.  
  - [x] Identify what you would focus on next in a real team setting (e.g., scaling to subsystem/SOC, adding more VIP, etc.).
