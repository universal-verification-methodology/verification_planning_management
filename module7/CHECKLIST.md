# Module 7 Checklist – Real-World Applications & VIP

> **Purpose**: Track completion of Module 7 real-world projects and VIP design.

> **Instructions**: Check off items as you complete them. Copy from `module7/templates/` if needed, or edit the file in `module7/` directly. Reference: `module7/.solutions/`.

## 1. Project Definition

- [ ] At least one substantial project is defined in `projects.md`.
- [ ] For each project:
  - [ ] DUT/IP and scope documented.
  - [ ] Key requirements and use cases listed.
  - [ ] Verification approach outlined (env, tests, coverage, regressions).

## 2. VIP / Environment Design

- [ ] `vip_design.md` created and filled for at least one VIP or environment.
- [ ] VIP components identified (agent, driver, monitor, sequencer, scoreboard, checker, coverage).
- [ ] Interfaces and transactions documented.
- [ ] Protocol rules / checks and coverage aspects documented.
- [ ] Configuration and reuse strategy documented.

## 3. Implementation Progress (High-Level)

- [ ] Initial env/VIP skeleton implemented in code (not just template).
- [ ] At least some basic tests run end-to-end on the chosen DUT/IP.
- [ ] Initial coverage reports or sanity metrics collected (where applicable).

## 4. Best Practices

- [ ] `best_practices.md` reflects project-specific decisions and standards.
- [ ] Code structure is clean (no obvious tangle of unrelated responsibilities).
- [ ] Naming and documentation are consistent and clear.
- [ ] Tests and regressions can be run and understood by another engineer.

## 5. Reflection and Review

- [ ] Projects and VIP design reviewed with peer/mentor or self-reviewed critically.
- [ ] Lessons learned and potential improvements captured in `projects.md` and/or `best_practices.md`.

## 6. Ready to Conclude the Course

- [ ] You can:
  - [ ] Walk through your VIP/env project as if presenting to a design/verification review.
  - [ ] Explain how planning, environment, coverage, regression, and architecture decisions support your goals.
  - [ ] Identify what you would focus on next in a real team setting (e.g., scaling to subsystem/SOC, adding more VIP, etc.).
